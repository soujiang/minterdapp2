#Welcome to our Airdrop to get free Electhrons.

We hope you got a free NFT to earn Electhrons, if not, you can buy one here <link para minteo NFT gratis>. You can also buy as many unique code NFTs as you want, thus increasing your chances of earning more Electhrons. 20,000,000 may seem like a lot of Electhrons but since there are a lot of people claiming them, they might run out soon.

If you haven't collected it yet, through our mint page you can get a free NFT that will allow you to earn Electrons and be part of our Airdrop. If you have already done so, the way to use your new NFT is simple, you must do the same as you did with the free NFT that you have collected.

To add a new NFT to the ones you already have, you only have to perform 3 steps:

Step 1. Mint your NFT with a unique code. The price of the NFT appears on the mint page.

Step 2. Register your NFT and the unique code that comes in the NFT, in the Telegram Bot that we have enabled for it here >TELEGRAM BOT< Just follow the instructions.

Step 3. Enter any of our social networks and participate in the activities to earn Electrons.

Note: Each NFT you buy to participate in this Airdrop, will allow you to accumulate free Electhrons automatically, so the more NFT with unique code you buy, the more Electhrons you can accumulate.
